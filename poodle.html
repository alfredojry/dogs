    <p>Besides their often-distinctive haircuts, the Poodle also happens to be a very smart and gentle dog. The breed is available in both miniature and standard sizes, meaning you can choose the specific Poodle size that best matches your living environment. They’re great for kids with allergies, as they shed very little.</p>
    <p>Each breed comes with different perks. The Standard breed, for example, is very obedient and smart, playful and adventurous (although often shy with strangers, they get along great with familiar people and kids). Miniatures, on the other hand, tend to dedicate themselves to one person in particular, but they are good with other pets and kids, and are smart, responsive, obedient and playful, making them a great match for kids, too. No matter the particular breed of Poodle, however, their coats do require scheduled grooming.</p>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you spoil your Poodle and don't train him, he's likely to conclude that he's the alpha dog of the family. This is especially common among the smaller varieties — Miniature and Toy Poodles — who are more likely to be coddled and untrained. Teach your dog good canine manners, and then insist that he use them; it shows him that you're the leader of the pack.</li>
      <li>Because of their intelligence and playful nature, obedience training is essential to keep your Poodle's mind active. A Poodle who is thinking and learning isn't bored, and therefore won't find destructive ways to occupy himself.</li>
      <li>The Poodle coat needs a lot of upkeep to stay beautiful and healthy. Most Poodle owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every three to six weeks. If you want to save money on grooming expenses, you can learn to do it yourself, but it takes time and effort.</li>
      <li>Poodles have weepy eyes that can stain the surrounding hair. To cut down on stains, gently wipe down the face daily with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dipped in warm water.</li>
      <li>To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.</li>
